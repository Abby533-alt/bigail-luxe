          <p className="text-md leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Ephis Shea Butter Production Company Ltd. is a legally registered and incorporated company in Ghana, operating under Sections 27 and 28 of the Companies Act 1963. We began business operations on the 12th of July, 2019, and are proudly located in Walewale, in the North East Region of Ghana.
          </p>
          <p className="text-md leading-relaxed mb-4">
            We specialize in the production of 100% natural shea butter for both local and international markets. Our mission is deeply rooted in community collaborationâ€”we work closely with dedicated women across the five Northern Regions of Ghana who collect shea nuts and supply them to us.
          </p>
          <p className="text-md leading-relaxed">
            By engaging many hands in our production process, we've not only expanded our capacity but also contributed to employment creation. From the women and girls who process the shea nuts into finished products, to those harvesting the nuts in the wild, Ephis Shea Butter is proud to support local livelihoods while delivering premium quality shea butter to the world.
          </p>
